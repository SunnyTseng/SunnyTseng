### Hi there 👋

This is Sunny! I was born and raised in a beautiful country called Taiwan, and now call Vancouver, Canada my second home — both places I hold close to my heart. I am a scientist, a writer, an artist, and a field recordist. Exploring this world with great enthusiasm and self-reflection is the way I guide my life. I work as an independent consultant, offering services as an **R data scientist** and **scientific infographic designer**. If you’re interested in collaborating or learning more, feel free to get in touch!

- 💻 I’m an R data scientist, proficient in R package development, Shiny apps, markdown documentation, and data wrangling/modeling for ecological questions. Most of my programming works can be found on Github!

- 🎨 I’m a scientific infographic designer, blending art and science. Check out [my portfolio](https://sunshineland.netlify.app/science)!

- 🐦 I’m an ornithologist focused on avian acoustic research, but I’m also interested in many other bird-related topics—like bird ringing, nest box building, and taxidermy. 

Check out my [website](https://sunnytseng.ca/) to learn more about me 😄
